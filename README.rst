RDOCloud-kubeup-manila
======================

This playbook creates a kubernetes cluster
in the RDOCloud and sets up
a minimal devstack environment there with the CephNFS backend.

The playbook borrows heavily from Luis Pabon's vagrant with
playbook for setting up the same sort of k8s cluster
locally with libvirt: git@github.com:lpabon/kubeup.git.

The playbook has been tested thus far on Fedora 29.

::

  [centos@worker0 ~]$ kubectl get nodes
  NAME               STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
  master.rdocloud    Ready    master   14h   v1.14.1
  worker0.rdocloud   Ready    <none>   9h    v1.14.1
  worker1.rdocloud   Ready    <none>   9h    v1.14.1
  worker2.rdocloud   Ready    <none>   9h    v1.14.1

Prerequisites
=============

We assume that you have credentials to use RDOCloud and that
you have set them up in ${HOME}/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
along the following lines. You can copy the clouds.yaml.sample
into ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml and make necessary changes.

::

  $ cat ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
  clouds:
    rdo-cloud:
        auth:
            auth_url: https://phx2.cloud.rdoproject.org:13000/v3
            project_name: <your-project-name>
            user_domain_name: Default
            project_domain_name: Default
            username: <your-user-name>
            password: <your-password>
        region: RegionOne

The ansible playbook needs the shade library. In Fedora 29 run ``sudo
dnf -y install python3-shade``.

Before you run the playbook edit copy keys.yml.sample to keys.yml and
edit the latter with the paths to your public and private ssh keys:

::

  $ cat keys.yml.sample
  ---
  # Set the name of the key known to the OpenStack cloud.
  key_name: devstack_keypair
  # Set the name of the local private key file associated
  # with the named key.
  private_key_file: "/path/to/your/private/key"
  public_key_file: "/path/to/your/public/key"

Note that the playbook starts four m1.large Nova instances in RDO
Cloud.  Check your remaining quota before running.  You can scale down
the number of worker nodes by editing roles/local/tasks/main.yml.

Playbooks
=========

Deploy
------

Now you can run the playbook::

$ ansible-playbook site.yml

The playbook will set up an appropriate security group, keypair, and
private network, and a router to connect the private network to the
RDOCloud public network.  It boots up four Nova VMs that comprise the
k8s cluster -- one master node and three workers -- installs kubeadm,
and runs kubeadm to set up the cluster.

For convenience, the playbook installs scripts, e.g. login-worker0.sh,
in the local directory that you can use to login to the nodes in the
cluster.

On worker0, the playbook installs devstack using a ``local.conf`` that
starts up only the minimal services -- keystone, mariadb, and rabbit
-- needed to run manila with a CephFS with NFS back end.

If you want to run more OpenStack services or run with other back ends
you can edit roles/devstack/files/local.conf before running the playbook.


Cleanup
-------

If you need to start over and you need to clean your environment, you
can use the cleanup.yml playbook.

Just run::

$ ansible-playbook cleanup.yml

This playbook will remove the created instances, the security group
and the network resources that were allocated.
